Even when I provided a concept drawing for them to TRACE, the results were still not what I expected. Buyers BEWARE: The seller's communication is excellent, friendly, and VERY kind. However, if you ask for any revisions, the revisions you will receive will be sloppy and half-a**ed.",

There were only 2 real contenders because the Fiverr site wouldn't allow me to attach my hand drawn idea. The paperclip icon was essentially rendered inactive, even after several attempts. This is no fault of the designers; i should have been even more descriptive with my request when I was unable to attach files.",

Even when I started to get picky with the design, nothing I requested was ever too much trouble.

This is the first project I'd commissioned so wasn't really sure on the correct etiquette, yet VD made things so easy for me. Can't recommend these guys enough for that",

The initial delivery had two good concepts and three concepts I did not like. The two good concepts however, where not really what I wanted though. I submitted a revision proposal and hoped for the best. This is where this seller shines! From the initial designs, he worked quickly with every suggestion I made for revisions and was good in communication. I slowly saw my project evolving to something I love. Recommended!",

You get what you pay for, and the price I think is a very good deal that's hard to find. Communication +asking questions is key to get all that you want and need from this great offer.

At first, I thought the experience of the designer was not the best due to finding some logos with minimal effort. Once I messaged the designer that I felt that the designs that they were producing were not satisfying me, they then were able to put a lot of effort into my ideas. I personally had to come up with the design of my logo instead of them using their experience and trusting them to come up with one themselves.
